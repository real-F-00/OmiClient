# OmiClient
OmiClient is a utility mod for the Hypixel pit made by Omi

obviously this forge mod is for Minecraft 1.8.9

This is a compilable, decompiled, remapped version of OmiClient, the code has been untouched apart for a few lines that wouldn't make it compile (dude is parsing floats but he's converting to doubles???)

To Compile run `omiclient > Tasks > build > buildNeeded` (DON'T BE DECEIVED BY `jar`) if it doesn't work run `clean` then try again
To Run inside the IDE run `omiclient > Tasks > forgegradle > runClient`

you need a Java 8 JDK, make sure to set them inside of the project settings and the gradle settings.
